    <title>Three Websites</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h2>Two good websites:</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://www.airbnb.com">Airbnb</a></h3>
    <p>I like this website mainly because of it's minimalism. They chose a classy color pallet of white and black with a small hint of red. This matches their audience who is looking for an easy and relaxing get away from their own lives and homes. The logo is very visible in the left hand corner, and it also has a minimal feel to it. In the right hand corner is the option to become a host, which is convenient because it saves time for someone who is not looking to stay at an airbnb. Next to the host button is a simple globe you can click on to select your language and region, which appeals to a global audience.
    <p>When you start to scroll, the banner at the top that contains the logo turns white, and the logo itself turns red, so there is a scrolling effect. There is a section right below the first, eye-catching photo that lists places nearby with cute, simple cartons.</p>
    <p>It is laid out mostly horizontally based, with columns ranging from 4 to 3 across, all containing photos with warm and inviting colors. There is even a section for pets allowed airbnbs.
        At the bottom of the webpage, there is 4 sections: About, Community, Host, and support, all with more items listed under them.
    </p>
    <p>It is very easy to navigate around; at the top, there are three options: Places to stay, Experiences, and Online Experiences. There is a header at the top that changes when you click one of the options to the information that is needed to be filled out. Places to stay allows you to put in your location, check in and out dates, and guests. Experiences asks you to put in the location and date of your trip. Online Experiences takes you to a new page where there is a list of online cultural experiences you can join digitally wherever you are, a sort of online community.
    </p>
    <p> There are around 110 tags in HTML5, and 32 tags newly introduced in it. Airbnb uses a lot of script and div tags. It does validate, meaning it meets the standards from the World Wide Web Consortium for the web.</p>
    <p>The Social Medias are linked at the bottom of the webpage, which I almost wish they were closer to the top and more visible though.</p>
    <p>Overall, the thing that sets airbnb's website apart is how navigating it is so easy because they have kept everything so simple, even the text is a simple san serif. The images have curved corners, which rests the eye well.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://swabtheworld.com/en/">Swab the World</a></h3>
    <p>This website is my favorite because it is fluid and engaging in many ways. The site moves with you as you scroll, which is cool. The colors are vibrant yet not shouty and thoughtfully paired together. It has a part on race where it lists statistics about blood cancer and race called The World is a Colourful Place, and it is clever because the backgroud and words change colors every few seconds. It feels like a modern, simple take that can hold the shortening attention spans of my generation because it changes often and uses language we use, like it states, "You stem cells are bored" as a way to get you to donate; this is language aimed at a younger audience.
    </p>
    <p>
        The layout makes sense to me and feels more like a funnel build, wider to narrower information. The main pictures are just outlines of people without backgrounds, but then they do have testimonies to make the website's cause more personal. The social media links are large, minimal, and in the colorscheme. Above them is a support or mission button and become a donor button, both quite large.
    </p>
    <p>It is very easy to navigate. For example, at the top header is a button with two lines, and when clicked, mor options pop up to chose from, like about us, blog, conferences, become a donor, donor stories, patients and survivors, and support our mission. Everything loads quickly as well.
    </p>
    <p>For colors, this site mainly uses a scooby doo palette, I'd say. Daphne purple, green, yellow, orange, and grey are the main colors. There is a lot of purple, and purple is the color of support ribbons for cancer in general.</p>
    <p>As far as coding, it uses a lot of script and div, elements in HTML5.</p>
    <p>What sets this website apart is its modern nature appeal combined with its minimalistic and east navigation. It uses scrolling banners, lines, circles, testimonials and more to grab your attention right away. Even the text is a modern san serif roboto.</p>


    <h2>One bad website (but also kind of epically so):</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com">Ling's Cars</a></h3>
    <p>This is one of the most chaotic websites I have ever had the honor to lay eyes upon. There is no color palette or pattern palette. There is a lot of animation and a lot of still images. There is a video of the owner on a motorcycle that makes 0 sense. The owner states that you can trust him simply because he is Ling, which makes me not trust him very much. There is way too much white space while also not enough of it at the same time. Ling had to try this hard to make a bad website; it couldn't happen on accident, not like this.
    </p>
    <p>The overall layout makes zero sense. There is no pictures except for Ling and cars. The only organized element is when in the blue sidebar, the cars are listed under each brand to click on. There is no set columns, exceot the cars range from 3 across to 4 with a lot of white space. There is also just a long scroll of white space at the end that is useless and not necessary.
    </p>
    <p>It is confusing to naviagte around. When I click on the links to the cars, the website lags and is slow. There is a navigation key in the blue sidebar that lists: Home, Cars, Vans, Customers, About Ling, Fun Stuff, and Live staff, some of these are very vague and unnecessary to selling a car. When you click one, off to the right pops up many more options to click, which is confusing.
    </p>
    <p> The coding is a lot shorter than the other two websites, but it does use some elements of HTML5, like script and div, but that is about it for coding.</p>
    <p>Let's just say this website uses the whole rainbow and then some. It looks a bit like someone ate a bowl of fruity pebbles with expired milk and then puked it onto the internet. So no, there is no color scheme, and the white space is used poorly.</p>
    <p>This site is unlike any site I have stumbled across. In summary, everything the two previous sites do that sets them apart, this site does the opposite that also results in being set apart.</p>
