            <h1>The Copper Kings</h1>
            <h3>William A. Clark</h3>
            <h5><i>"I never bought a man who wasn't for sale."</i></h5>
            <p>Clark came to Montana on the cusp of the gold rush and found that he could make more money selling things to miners than he could mining, hence the begininngs of his shipping goods fortune to Bannack from Salt Lake. Clark is the reason for Las Vegas located in Clark County because one of his shipping railroads ran through a dusty railroad watering stop which would grow to become Las Vegas. From trading goods, Clark went into Banking and then into silver mines in Butte. His main competitor in the Butte mines was Marcus Daly.</p>
            <p>This fued between Clark and Daly is actually the main reason the capital of Montana is Helena. Daly fought hard to get the capital to be Anaconda, and Clark saw how much Daly wanted that. Naturally, Clark had to interfere, so he supported Helena's opposing bid for it. In the end, Helena won, and the capitol was built there.</p>
            <p>Clark is the reason for the 17th Amendment in the US Constitution that was passed in 1914, which states that United States senators will be directly elected by the people and now the legislature. In 1899, Clark sought to further his political ambitions by buying his way into the U.S. Senate. Because of the obvious corruption, the Senate refused to seat him. In 1901, he won another Senate race (more or less) fairly, and served Montana, and himself, as a Senator until 1907.</p>
            <p>Clark was an unpopular politican, even hated by Mark Twain who wrote the following about him, "He is as rotten a human being as can be found anywhere under the flag; he is a shame to the American nation, and no one has helped to send him to the Senate who did not know that his proper place was the penitentiary, with a ball and chain on his legs. To my mind he is the most disgusting creature that the republic has produced since Tweedâ€™s time."</p>
            <p>Odd fun fact but William Clark's uncle was set to go back on the Titanic before it sunk in 1912.</p>
            <p>Clark's mansion, known today as the Copper King Mansion, sits high on the hill in uptown Butte. It had a stunning all around view of Butte until Daly purposefully bought the land next to it to build a hotel to obscure part of Clark's view. It is now a bed and breakfast where many people can enjoy the true beauty of the mansion. My sister used to work there and give tours when she was in high school.</p>
            <p>Clark also famoulsy built New York City's most extravagant and expensive mansion. Located at 962 Fifth Avenue, the mansion would be built over four years and take up a whole block. It cost $7 million back then, which equivalates around $180 million in todays dollars. The mansion contained 121 rooms decorated in meieval tapestries and artwork, 31 baths, four art galleries, a swimming pool, a concealed garage, a Gothic library that was 90 ft long, the largest chamber organ in America with 62 "speaking stops", and a private underground rail line to bring in coal for heat. It is reported that Clark bought a quarry in New Hampshire for $50,000, around %1.3 million today, and built a direct railroad to New York to get stone for his mansion. He also bought a bronze foundry that employed 200 men so that he could manufacture bronze fittings for the home. Also, he imported marble from Italy, oak from Sherwood Forest in England, and parts of the old French Chateaux for the interior.</p>
            <p>Despite the effort and exspense of the mansion, many called it "an appropriate residence for the late P.T. Barnum" or "Clark's Folly." After Clark's death, the mansion was sold for less than half its original cost, and 17 years after its completition, the mansion was demolished in order to build a luxury apartment building.</p>
            <p>Upon his death in 1925 observers conservatively calculated his fortune at over $200 million. In contemporary terms, that would be roughly equivalent to $31 billion; only Bill Gates and Warren Buffett exceed that total.</p>

            <h3>Marcus Daly</h3>
            <h5><i>The luck of the Irish.</i></h5>
            <p>Daly was an Irish immigrant who moved from Salt Lake to Butte in 1876 to work as the agent for the Walker Brothers mining company. He was a skilled geologist and engineer, so when Butte's silver started drying up, he knew that Butte held huge amounts of copper and that with Edison's recent invention of the lightbulb, copper would boom with the need for electricity. Daly proceeded to buy up the Anaconda and surrounding mines in the 1880s to launch the Anaconda Mining Company, which would at one point become the fourth largest company in the world.</p>
            <p>Daly is the main reason Butte and Anaconda are known for being Irish Catholics. Irish and Italian immigrants were discrimnated against when they came over to the US, but they knew they could get jobs in mining. Many would head straight to Butte and Anaconda after arriving in the US. Daly would make an effort to hire Irish workers.</p>
            <p>In 1899, Daly sold his vast company to members of Standard Oil for $39 million.</p>
            <p>Marcus Daly died in New York City's Netherlands Hotel, November 12, 1900 of complications of diabetes and a bad heart. He was 58 years old. His death came near the New York Harbor, where as a 15 year old Irish immigrant, Marcus Daly first glimpsed the America of his dreams. His remains were placed in the Daly mausoleum in Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
            <p>Marcus Daly was not a man to share confidence or talk about himself. He did not leave the details of the history of his life to be recorded. Shortly after the death of Marcus Daly, his personal records from Anaconda were sent to the Bitterroot Stock Farm and burned.</p>
            <h3>F. Augustus Heinze</h3>
            <h5><i>The one with 30 lawyers.</i></h5>
            <p>Heinze was a son of immigrants and had an impressive engineering education. He came to Butte in 1894, long after the feud between Clark and Daly had begun. Heinze began to challenge Daly when he established a copper smelter.</p>
            <p>Heinze was probably the Copper King that was most liked by the peope because he reduced the working day from 10 to 8 hours.</p>
            <p>Heinze also bosted a strong legal team because he loved to exploit the law of apex that stated a minor could follow a vein that orininated on their property, even if it went onto someone else's property. This led to Heinze's minors following a vein that went over to the Amalgamated mine, where they extracted over 100,000 tons of ore before the Amalgamate mine noticed and tried to stop them. This led to the miners fighting each other with planted grenades, hand to hand combat, shooting each other with high pressured hoses, smoking each other out by burning rubber, collapsing tunnels with dynamite and fouling tunnels with caustic lime. Eventually, the Amalgamated bought Heinze out to end the war, and Heinze moved in 1906 to New York with his earnings.</p>
            <p>In New York, he became a powerful financial speculator, and his schemes with his brothers in New York are said to have caused the Financial Panic of 1907, a crisis that lasted over three weeks when the New York Stock Exchange fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year, and to have led to the creation of the US Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States of America.</p>
