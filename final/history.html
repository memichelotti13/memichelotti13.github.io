            <h1>Evel Knievel</h1>
            <h3><b>Early Life</b></h3>
            <p>Born in Butte, Montana on October 17, 1938, Robert Craig Knievel was raised by his grandparents. At age eight he saw Joey Chitwood's Auto Daredevil Show, which he credits for his later career choice to become a motorcycle daredevil. He dropped out of high school to work in the Butte Copper mines, and eventually, he was promoted to surface duty, where he drove an earth mover. He was dismissed from the mines when he did a wheelie in the earth mover and accidently drove it into Butte's main power line; the city was left without power for a few hours.</p>
            <h3><b>Career</b></h3>
            <p>In 1965, Knievel began his daredevil career when he formed a troupe called Evel Knievel's Motorcycle Daredevils. They toured and performed stunts like riding through fire, jumping over snakes and mountain lines, and being towed at 200 mph behind drag race cars holding onto a parachute.</p>
            <h3><b>Jumps</b></h3>
            <p>He started off charging $500 for a jump over two cars. By New Years Day 1968, he jumped 151 feet across the fountains in front of Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. Over the next few years, his payments went up over a million per jump when he jumped over 13 buses at Wembley Stadium in London and set a new world record by jumping 19 cars in Ontario, California. When he jumped over Snake River Canyon, he was paid $6 million. On October 25 1975, after jupming 14 greyhound buses in Ohio, Evel Knievel announced his retirement. He jumped for the last time in March 1981 in Hollywood, Florida.</p>
            <h3><b>Crashes and Breaks</b></h3>
            <p>Throughout his career, Evel Knievel spent a total of 3 years in the hospital. Here's a list of all of the damage Knievel took from his daredevil jumps:</p>
            <li>Broke his collarbone and shoulder in a motorcross accident</li>
            <li>Suffered numerous comas - one for 30 days and another for 29 days</li>
            <li>Very badly broken arm</li>
            <li>Several broken ribs</li>
            <li>3 Serious concussions</li>
            <li>Broken left wrist</li>
            <li>Broken right knee</li>
            <li>Crushed pelvis</li>
            <li>Crushed femur</li>
            <li>Fractures to his hip</li>
            <li>Broke both wrists and ankles</li>
            <li>Broke his right leg and foot</li>
            <li>Compound fracture to his right arm and broke both legs again</li>
            <li>Broke his back</li>
            <p>Maybe being a daredevil is not as glamorous as it seems.</p>
            <p>“Years ago I was just helter-skelter. I defied death. And I’m still doing it - only from a bed instead of a bike. There’s just no quit in me. There’s just no stopping me. I went through life big-bang-bada-boom-bada-boom. Now it’s just bing, but I’m still Evel Knievel. I am. There’s just nothing you could do to stop me.” - Evel Knievel</p>

            <h3><b>End of Life</b></h3>
            <p>Knievel died in Clearwater, Florida on November 30, 2007. Knievel was buried in his hometown of Butte, Montana on December 10, 2007 following a funeral at the Butte Civic Center. Fireworks exploded in the Butte night sky as pallbearers carried Knievel's casket into the center.</p>
            <h3><b>His Message</b></h3>
            <p>International media attention to Evel's heroic, death-defying feats and his popular messages to the world's youth, promoting abstention from drugs and a healthy lifestyle with a positive mental attitude quickly transformed him into a national icon. In 1999, Knievel was inducted into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame. His motorcycle and memorabilia display by the Smithsonian Institute in their Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. has immortalized him as America's Legendary Daredevil.</p>
