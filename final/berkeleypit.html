            <h1>The Berkeley Pit</h1>
            <h3><b>Before</b></h3>
            <p>The open-pit copper mine was opened in 1955 and operated by Marcus Daly's Anadonda Copper Mining Company, which was at one point the fourth largest company in the world. This mine is where three of Butte's ethinical neighborhoods used to be: East Butte, McQueen - the Croatian neighborhood-, and Meaderville - the Italian neighborhood. My grandfather grew up in McQueen with his family, and his house has to be moved when the land was bought for mining.</p>
            <p>Within the first year of operation, the pit extracted 17,000 tons of ore per day at a grade of 0.75% copper. Ultimately, about 1,000,000,000 tons of material were mined from the Berkeley Pit. Copper was the principal metal produced, although other metals were also extracted, including silver and gold. Over the active lifespan of the mine, approximately 320 million tons of ore and over 700 million tons of waste rock were mined from the Pit. In other words, it produced enough copper to pave a four-lane highway two inches thick from Chicago to New York, with enough left over to keep going to the tip of Long Island.</p>
            <p>The mine was then later bought by the Atlantic Richfield Company -ARCO- until it closed on Earth Day in 1982. Because of its closing, the water pumps near the Kelley Mine were shut off at 3,800 ft below the surface, and groundwater from the aquifers slowly began to fill the Berkeely Pit, rising 1 ft a month.</p>
            <h3><b>After</b></h3>
            <p>The Berkeley Pit is one mile long by half mile wide and over 1,780 ft deep. Around 1,000 ft of the Pits' depth is filled with acidic water that is a vibrant turqoise and green. The Berkeley Pit is currently the largest superfund cleanup site in the world. The water contains dissolved oxygen that allows pyrite and sulfide materials to decay in the rock walls, which releases acid.</p>
            <p>Construction began on The Horseshoe Bend Water Treatment Plant at the Berkeley Pit in 2018, to treat water in the Pit before it would contaminate local groundwater. The treatment facility will be able to treat ten million gallons of water per day using lime to raise the pH and remove heavy metals. Construction of the $19 million facility was completed in August 2019[14] and the first discharge of treated water into a local creek happened in October 2019.</p>
            <h3><b>Migrating Birds</b></h3>
            <p>In 1995, a flock of migrating snow geese landed in the Pit and drink some of its water. They were later found dead, with their esophagi melted from the acidic water. A total of 342 birds died.</p>
            <p>In 2016, thousands of snow geese died after landing in the Pit to avoid a snow storm.</p>
            <p>The Berkeley Pit started utilizing Phoenix Wailers, which have been effective in deterring birds from landing at or staying in Berkeley Pit for an extended period of time. Studies have shown that the Wailers have been effective in limiting bird deaths in most cases, but they have not worked as well when faced with a large number of birds. Staff also use firearms to scare away birds during spring migration seasons</p>
            <h3><b>New Species</b></h3>
            <p>New fungal and bacterial species have been found to have adapted to the harsh conditions inside the Pit. These new species are quite similar to those found in the hot pots of Yellowstone National Park; however, it is much easier to get a permit to study the Pit than Yellowstone. In the Pit, intense competition for the limited resources caused these species to evolve the production of highly toxic compounds to improve survivability, some of which have been isolated from these organisms and show selective activity against cancer cell lines. Research is still being conducted today on these new findings.</p>
