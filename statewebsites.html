<head><b>Review of State Websites</b></head>

    <h1>
        <a href="https://alaska.gov">Alaska</a>
    </h1>

    <ul>
        <li>I like the navy colors of the website because they seem to fit the image of Alaska in my head. There is a picture of a mountian, that I assume may be Mount Mckinley. They have the state seal, and they also have a phrase of welcome from the Deg Xinag people of Alaska, which adds inclusiveness to the website. They have the current governing administration near the top on the right side. They also have updates about COVID-19 right at the top.</li>
        <li>The website actually loaded quickly for a government website; I wonder how much traffic Alaska's page gets overall. The menus are very easy to navigate, but there is a ton of information on the homepage, almost overwhelming. When I run my mouse over pictures, menus pop up.</li>
        <li>The website works well when I change the size of it on my screen.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1><a href="https://www.iowa.gov">Iowa</a></h1>

    <ul>
        <li>This state website uses the color palette of mostly navy blue, with hints purple, red, orange, and green. I like the background images of the website that have a tint of navy blue over them. There is a big search bar near the top, and I like the menu that lists: Home, Business, Government, Health, Education, General, and Contact; very easy to navigate. The current governing administration is listed towards the top. I like how if you scroll down, there is an area for facts about Iowa, like the state flower, state bird, etc.; this adds a layer of intrigue.</li>
        <li>The website is very easy to navigate because they have certain things listed in different menus and use different colors to separate things. Also, the website loads quickly, a bit slower than Alaska's though. The website works well on my phone and laptop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1><a href="https://oklahoma.gov">Oklahoma</a></h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Oklahoma's website uses white space very well, and it uses it as a type of border to separate items. At the top of the page, there is a translate button, which is inclusive. There is a search bar at the top as well, but no menu there. All of the options to navigate to have pictures attached to them, which is a bit much overall to the eye. It is a very simple homepage compared to the levels of information that was on Alaska and Iowa.</li>
        <li>The website loaded quickly; however, with all the minimalism, it is a bit difficult to navigate the website without searching for what you need. The website works well on my phone and laptop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1><a href="https://www.tn.gov">Tennessee</a></h1>

    <ul>
        <li>The main colors here are navy and a crimson red. This website also uses white space well as a barrier to break up items and menus. I like how there is a calendar that lists all upcoming public meetings. There is also very visible links to other government social media, which makes them appeal to a range of audiences. There is a menu bar at the top that lists: Careers, Residents, Business, Government, Directory, Help, etc., and above that is a search bar to navigate the site.</li>
        <li>This website loaded fast and keeps a consistent color theme throughout. There is not an overwhelming amount of information on the homepage, just a nice balance of info and aesthetically pleasing. This site works well on different size screens and on different window sizes on my laptop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1><a href="https://www.vermont.gov/#gsc.tab=0">Vermont</a></h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Vermont's website uses the palette of mostly white, with hintes of blue and green. I like the menu at the top that lists Live, Work, Explore, Learn, Government, and Online Services. When a menu item is clicked, it drops down a whole new section. There is a lot of pictures on this website that fit well with their menu categories, and I would find all the pictures overwhelming but a nice balance is formed with the white space. There is an area for the latest news with linked articles, which keeps people up to date. There is a complete list of all statewide officials.</li>
        <li>This website loaded fast, and clicks within this website are quick as well. I like the calming and assuring color scheme of white, blue, and green. I think this site showcases Vermont very well with pretty images of the Capitol and towns. This site works well on different size screens, like my phone and laptop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. Favortie State Website: Vermont</h2>
    <p>I liked Vermont the best because it didn't sacifice aesthetics for navigability; there was a nice balance of invite and curiosity with its layout, like how it put pictures towards the top to catch your attention.</p>

    <h2>2. That State</h2>
    <p>Vermont is known for its beauty and nature, especially in the fall. The state has voted Democratic in every election since 2004. It ranks #8 in the United States in education. Visiting their government website makes me want to visit the state, and that's how I know it's a well-done website.</p>

    <h2>3. Red State: Tennessee</h2>
    <p>Tennessee is a red state, and I think their website reflects that in the layout and colors chosen. They chose navy and crimson red, both strong colors. There is less white space on this website. However, it is organized very logical. This website feels the best balanced out of all of them as far as government/professional feeling, necessary information, and aesthetics combined.</p>

    <h2>4. Blue State: Vermont</h2>
    <p>Vermont is a blue state, and I think that is shown in the easier color scheme they picked of mostly white with hints of blue and green.</p>

    <h2>5. Least Favorite State Website: Alaska</h2>
    <p>While the information was accurate, I don't feel like this site captured the beauty and vastness of Alaska. I think there needs to be more white space and more nature pictures. I wish they would put more accessible and aesthetic links to social media to showcase this stunning state and maybe do what Iowa did where they list some fun state facts with little pictures, like state tree, etc. The sections need to be broken up more either by white space or menus because there is too much info and not enough spacing. </p>
